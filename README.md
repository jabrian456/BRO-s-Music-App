Description
Tracks what music an individual listens to, and pairs them with others based on that music. Could be potentially used as a dating app, or just meeting new friends with similar music tastes.

App Evaluation
Category: Music Conventer App
Mobile: This is app where users can download music and mp3. While user is able to download songs, user will be able to listen to music while the phone is in airplane mode
Story: Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices from youtube datebase. The user can authorize downloads and do aubile books also through the app.
Market: Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
Scope: First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
